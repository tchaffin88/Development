This website was a first go at web development for a Halo LAN Party event I hosted at my house

It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for both front end and back end for the API submission of the form via POST to Resend

Websites used for this to work are vercel.com and resend.com

I created a domain called haloparty.social via namecheap.com

RSVP form is fully functional and sends emails from noreply@haloparty.social

Many of the images are from halo.fandom.com/wiki while others are simply from AI (CoPilot)

May revisit this in the future for different events and try changing the CSS for a different look.
